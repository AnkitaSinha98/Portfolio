       will attempt to render the page in an incorrect view.
		
2) character_set:
    <meta charset="utf-8">

	   human-readable text and vice versa to be displayed in the browser.

3) Responsive Web Design Viewport:
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	   Setting The Viewport The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow 
	   the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

	   loaded by the browser.
	   
4)Jumbotron

     A jumbotron indicates a big box for calling extra attention to some special content 
	   or information. A jumbotron is displayed as a grey box with rounded corners. It also

	   nearly any valid HTML, including other Bootstrap elements/classes.
